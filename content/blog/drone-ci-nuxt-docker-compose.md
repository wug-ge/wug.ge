# How to deploy your Nuxt.js Projects with Drone CI and Docker Compose
<br>
In this short blogpost I'll explain how to deploy your Nuxt.js projects with Drone CI and Docker Compose.<br>
I assume you have a running Drone CI installation with a Docker runner.
You can find the source code with an example project using this setup (actually it's this blog you are currently reading) here: [Wug.ge Github](https://github.com/wug-ge/wug.ge "Wug.ge Github Repo").

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
